STM32:

A family of 32-bit microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics.

Based on ARM Cortex-M cores.

Widely used in embedded systems due to high performance and rich peripherals.

FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array):

A semiconductor device that can be programmed to implement custom digital circuits.

Offers parallelism and high-speed custom hardware design.

Popular vendors: Xilinx (Artix-7), Intel (Altera).

 Why Use UART?
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol.

Simple, asynchronous (no clock line), point-to-point communication.

Widely supported on both STM32 and FPGA platforms.

Perfect for debugging, data logging, and communication between MCUs and FPGAs.

Project Overview
Goal:
To establish UART communication between STM32 and FPGA such that:

STM32 sends a character via UART.

FPGA receives, processes (e.g., increment ASCII), and sends it back.

Data is displayed on FPGA peripherals (LEDs, LCD, 7-segment).
